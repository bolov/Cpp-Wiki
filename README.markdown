## Background and Scope

This is the result of several years of teaching experience. It is meant as both a learning tool and as a C++ reference.

It follows a bottom-up approach. This allows for a better understanding of the language, starting with a solid foundation.

## Bottom-up vs Top-down learning

### Bottom-up

This way you learn the *bricks* first, the basic and primitive tools. Later you will come in contact with the high-level api which will allow you to write elegant code, the way C++ is now meant to be written.

#### Advantages

- better understanding and appreciation of the mechanisms and concepts that drive C++
- almost everything you learn is explained how it works.
- you will be able to understand and build yourself high-level and abstract objects, algorithms and concepts

#### Disadvantages

- you will start with didactic examples and exercises.
- longer road until you end up writing programs that solve real problems
- the way you will end up writing C++ won't resemble the way you started learning it

### Top-down

With this approach you learn how to use high-level abstractions right from the start. You won't concern yourself too much with how and why they work.

#### Advantages

- you learn the elegant and modern C++ right from the start
- you get to solve real problems early in the learning experience. This can be a very strong motivation for some people

#### Disadvantages

- you won't initially understand how things work underneath
